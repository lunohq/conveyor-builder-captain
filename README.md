# conveyor-builder-captain

Docker image that can be used by conveyor to build images using captain.

This is a fork of:
https://github.com/remind101/conveyor/blob/master/builder/docker/bin/build
which leverages [captain](https://github.com/harbur/captain) to support
customizing the build flow within each repository.
